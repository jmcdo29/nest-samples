# nest-commander-sample

This is a simple command written to be a supplement to what's in the [nest-commander docs](https://jmcdo29.github.io/nest-commander). 

## Running

To run the command, first run the build from the project root

```sh
nx build nest-commander
```

Then you can simply use `node` to fire the command

```sh
node dist/apps/nest-commander/main 'echo Hello World!'
```

And that's all there is to it!.
